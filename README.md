# ZeroKataGame
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe Game aka Zero-Kata Game
In this project I've used HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- In JavaScript Part I've made use of arrow functions, audio constructor.
- In CSS I've also tried :root selector to define variables and their properties
This had been an amazing project I got to learn a lot and entire journey of making this project was fun!!
